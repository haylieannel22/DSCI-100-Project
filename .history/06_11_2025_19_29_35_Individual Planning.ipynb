    "The proposed method for, can the average start hour predict whether a player is a high or low data contributor is to use k-nearest neighbours (KNN) classification. kNN would assign an observation to being either a high contributor or a low contributor. The predictor variable is start_hour, and the response variable is high_contributer, a binary variable indicating whether a player contributes above or below the median amount of data. This approach allows classification based on similarity to other players’ behaviour and is suitable for exploratory predictive analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "kNN is suitable because it handles binary classification without strong assumptions and identifies patterns based on similarity. It assumes players with similar starting hours will belong in the same class, and observations are independent. Limitations include k sensitivity and imbalanced daWhile kNN can be flexible and simple, it can be very sensitive to the choice of k and any imbalanced data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the model, the average start hour will be calculated for each player and merged with their total data contributions to create the binary response. The dataset will be randomly split into a 70% training set and a 30% testing set. Model performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, and k-fold cross-validation will be used on the training set to select the best value of k and ensure the model generalizes well."
