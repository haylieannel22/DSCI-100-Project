    "These two data sets contain session-level information, including player identities, start and end times, and the hours played (data contributed) per session. To answer the question, first, the players.csv and sessions.csv datasets will be joined using the hashed player's email as a key. For the sessions dataset, the start time will be separated from the date and made into its own column to make the data tidy. For each player, the average start hour across all of their sessions will be calculated. This value will be linked to their total data contribution from the  players' data set. The resulting dataset will allow for predictive analysis to determine whether the average start time can be used to classify players as high or low data contributors.\n"
